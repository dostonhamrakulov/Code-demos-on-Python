# HTTP POST method example with storing data on cookie and file

### Description:
This script offers an HTTP-Server based on TCP-Sockets at the port 5000. When visiting http://localhost:5000 you should see a web form that shows your current bank account balance and the option to transfer an amount of money. After submitting the form, the new balance is displayed.

**Two ways of Implementation**
* In HTTP_POST_and_Cookie.py
    * Account balance will be stored in Cookie and even if you close the tab or connect, the account balance will be retrieved.
* in HTTP_POST_and_File.py
    * Account balance will be stored in file (konto.txt) and program takes value everytime from that file.
