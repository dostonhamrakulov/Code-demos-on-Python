# Working with Linux commands in Python script/ Utilities for running commands

### Description:
The **commands** module contains wrapper functions for **os.popen()** which take a system command as a string and return any output generated by the command and, optionally, the exit status.

The **subprocess** module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results. Using the **subprocess** module is preferable to using the commands module.


### Deprecated since version 2.6: 
The **commands** module has been removed in Python 3. Use the **subprocess** module instead.
